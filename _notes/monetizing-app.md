# monetizing franc

franc has a unique user type. The app will be used in short bursts mostly during the festival season. The user will not be in the app for long periods of time. SO... advertising doesn't make sense. At least in my opinion.

Initial Questions:
- what are the costs of running franc for 1 user?

## concept 1
- Offer franc as a one-time paid download — $4.99 or $5.99.
- Then have additional features which can be purchased. For example the ability to go invisible could be an upgrade the person can purchase for $2.99.

## concept 2
- Offer franc as a freemium app (free to download — but it is a limited version).
- The app will only allow the person to find 5 people. Then we have a price structure for finding more. Something like: add 10 for $4.99, 20 for $6.99, 40 for $10.99, and $15.99 for an unlimited number of people.
- Then have upgrades like being invisible for something like $2.99... "make invisible free or super cheap .99¢" - @lewisalexj

## additional ways of being profitable
- license the use of franc in festival apps. For example SummerCamp has a schedule app they use... maybe we can plugin franc and allow festival goers to use the app. Perhaps $3 per goer...
- add a scheduling part to franc to sell the app as an entire package to festivals.
- add some advertising during certain months, then allow users to purchase the ability to not see ads.
