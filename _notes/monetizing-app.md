# monetizing franc

franc has a unique user type. The app will be used in short bursts mostly during the festival season. The user will not be in the app for long periods of time. SO... advertising doesn't make sense. At least in my opinion.

Initial Questions:
- what are the costs of running franc for 1 user?
* about $1.00 per user per year

## individual monetization
We have finally figured out how we are going to monetize franc for the individual consumer. We are going to allow the user to use franc for an entire year for free. This will allow users to get in and experience the app in it's entirety. Then once the year is over we are going to charge a yearly subscription fee. This makes the most sense for our ideal user.
- yearly cost per person is $1.25 per year (rough estimate)
- $.50 per user towards the company for equipment(computers, monitors, apps, servers, git private, mail chimp account, etc.), general company cost(licenses, lawyer, office space(if needed), etc.)
- $.75 per user towards company savings for expansion, etc.
- $1.25 per user for potential salaries
** $3.75 per person per user
we should think of increasing the value to $6 or even $8 a year, but I would like to discuss this with you two. I want to keep it under $10... but don't want to under value the service provided. I would pay $6 a year to be able to find my friends easily at shows... just saying.

## B2B (festival monetization)



#### OLD IDEAS #####

## concept 1
- Offer franc as a one-time paid download — $4.99 or $5.99.
- Then have additional features which can be purchased. For example the ability to go invisible could be an upgrade the person can purchase for $2.99.

## concept 2
- Offer franc as a freemium app (free to download — but it is a limited version).
- The app will only allow the person to find 5 people. Then we have a price structure for finding more. Something like: add 10 for $4.99, 20 for $6.99, 40 for $10.99, and $15.99 for an unlimited number of people.
- Then have upgrades like being invisible for something like $2.99... "make invisible free or super cheap .99¢" - @lewisalexj

## additional ways of being profitable
- license the use of franc in festival apps. For example SummerCamp has a schedule app they use... maybe we can plugin franc and allow festival goers to use the app. Perhaps $3 per goer...
- add a scheduling part to franc to sell the app as an entire package to festivals.
- add some advertising during certain months, then allow users to purchase the ability to not see ads.
