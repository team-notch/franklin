- We've all been there... one part of your group wants to groove at the funk show, another wants to have a bluegrass hoedown, another is arriving later this evening and **YOU ALL** want to meet for the headliner! How do you make sure this all goes down smoothly without a hitch? Franc. Franc makes sure you're never alone at the show.

what do you do to make this stress free, easy, and make sure you all meet up?

- Franc turns your phone into a beacon so you're never lost.
- Franc let's you ask others to stay put so you can meet up.
- Franc is private, you have the final say in who can find you.


what can you do to make this all go off without a hitch?
