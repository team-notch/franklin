1. franc is that festival detail ticket holders will appreciate and talk about on their blogs, social media... everywhere. "[insert your festival name] gave me a way of finding and meeting up with my friends. They really thought of everything! And did you see the Wilco show?" Get people talking positively about your festival not just for the entertainment, but because you care about them. franc is that extra "thing" that makes your festival top notch! Email us(james@findfranc.com) to get franc for your festival.
2. franc gives your ticket holders the ability to find and meet up with their friends during the festival which means they will spend more time enjoying the amazing entertainment you took months planning. Imagine what festival goers would think if you offered the ability to see a schedule then easily find and meet up with their friends. "[insert your festival name] gave me a way of finding and meeting up with my friends. They really thought of everything!"
