## site layout
- elevator pitch
- top section describes the problem, makes a connection with the user the "yeah... I've been there!"
- which leads to franc the solution section

- all along the way there needs to be a way to download the app

### top section - copy
- We've all been there... one part of your group wants to groove at the funk show, another wants to have a bluegrass hoedown, another is arriving later this evening and **YOU ALL** want to meet for the headliner! How do you make sure this all goes down smoothly without a hitch? Franc. Franc makes sure you're never alone at the show.

what do you do to make this stress free, easy, and make sure you all meet up?

- Franc turns your phone into a beacon so you're never lost.
- Franc let's you ask others to stay put so you can meet up.
- Franc is private, you have the final say in who can find you.

what can you do to make this all go off without a hitch?

### app screenshot section
- Who do you see shows with? Add your friends so you can easily find each other at shows or festivals. Don’t worry… you have control over who can find you using franc.
- Where is everyone? Always know where your friends are using the map.
- Who's on the move and who's digging their spot at a show? Can we meet up? Ask them to "stay put" so y'all can meet up.
- Enjoy the show with friends!

## festival/venue section
- Does the festival have an app already?
- is someone interested in having franc plugged into their existing festival app?
- would a festival like to add franc as an offering to ticket holders?
- do we include pricing? I don't want to scare people away or under value the service.


2. franc gives your ticket holders the ability to easily find and meet up with their friends during the festival at any moment, during any show, from anywhere. Imagine offering your ticket holders the line-up, schedule, location of their friends, and the ability to meet up with them. This means they'll be able to spend more time enjoying the amazing entertainment stress free.

If you're interested in adding franc to your current festival app email me, james@findfranc.com.

- Don't have an app yet?
Don't worry! We can fix that. Send me, james@findfranc.com, an email and we can discuss developing a branded app for your festival which will include your festival's line-up, schedule, and franc!

- **pricing** We need to figure this out. Should it just be a value per person? Or should we also include a set up fee for getting franc plugged into their app? Does it need to be a single year license? There are a lot of open questions here...
