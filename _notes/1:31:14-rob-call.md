- is there a reason to pay? I could easily find a way around it.
- huge market if the best technology

- rob wants to be kept in the loop. once we get further he wants to help to see where/how it can grow.
- talent buyers are the marketers and are the people to talk to. It is easy for him, and if he likes/believes in the product he can set up calls for us.
